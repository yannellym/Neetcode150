-- Explanation: 
-- Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
-- Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
-- Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
-- Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
-- Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
  # better approach
SELECT

    Products as p 
JOIN 
    Orders as o 
ON

GROUP BY 
    product_name 
HAVING 
    unit >= 100


# first approach

SELECT product_name, SUM(unit) as unit

        FROM Products as p 
        JOIN Orders as o

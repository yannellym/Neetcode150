# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
;


# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM logs
WHERE (id + 1, num) IN (SELECT * FROM logs)
    AND (id + 2, num) IN (SELECT * FROM logs);

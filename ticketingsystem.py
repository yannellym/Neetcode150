# Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

# Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

# Example

# For n = 1230, the output should be
# solution(n) = true;
# For n = 239017, the output should be
# solution(n) = false.

# [input] integer n

# A ticket number represented as a positive integer with an even number of digits.

# Guaranteed constraints:
# 10 â‰¤ n < 106.

# [output] boolean

# true if n is a lucky ticket number, false otherwise.

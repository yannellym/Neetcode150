Table: Queue

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id column contains unique values.
This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.
weight is the weight of the person in kilograms.
 

There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Queue table:
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
| 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
| 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
| 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |
| 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| person_name |
+-------------+
| John Cena   |
+-------------+
Explanation: The folowing table is ordered by the turn for simplicity.
+------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
| Turn | ID | Name      | Weight | Total Weight |
+------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
| 1    | 5  | Alice     | 250    | 250          |
| 2    | 3  | Alex      | 350    | 600          |
| 3    | 6  | John Cena | 400    | 1000         | (last person to board)
| 4    | 2  | Marie     | 200    | 1200         | (cannot board)
| 5    | 4  | Bob       | 175    | ___          |
| 6    | 1  | Winston   | 500    | ___          |

# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- Main SELECT statement to get the 'person_name'
SELECT person_name
FROM (
    -- Subquery to calculate cumulative weight for each person in the queue
    SELECT 
        person_name,   -- Select the person's name
        turn,          -- Select the turn (the order of the person in the queue)
        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) cum_weight  -- Calculate the cumulative weight up to the current person, ordered by turn
    FROM Queue 
) as sub  -- Alias the subquery as 'sub'

-- Filter to get only those persons whose cumulative weight is less than or equal to 1000
WHERE cum_weight <= 1000

-- Order by cumulative weight in descending order so that the person who is closest to 1000 without exceeding it appears first
ORDER BY cum_weight DESC

-- Limit the result to only one person, which will be the person closest to 1000
LIMIT 1;
